Geoffrey: Thanks for joining. Let’s finalize applications today. We’ve delayed this twice already, and other departments are blocked until we lock the number.
Cian: Agreed. I reviewed the full shortlisted pool this morning. The quality is strong, but capacity is our constraint.
Max: From Stockholm’s side, we’re aligned on infrastructure for up to 320, but financially I’d prefer we cap at 300.
Geoffrey: Paris operations confirmed they can comfortably manage 300. Anything beyond that increases catering and materials complexity.
Cian: Then let’s finalize 300 accepted participants.
Max: Agreed. Geoffrey: Good. Now operational follow-up. We need confirmation emails out quickly — within 24 hours ideally.
Cian: Yes. Operations should handle sending confirmation emails, including instructions about check-in, badge collection, and required documents.
Max: The email must clearly state confirmation deadline. We need responses within 72 hours.
Geoffrey: Agreed. Let’s assign that to the Operations department.
Cian: Once confirmations start coming in, IT must create accounts on the event platform for each confirmed participant.
Max: Yes, and the accounts must include access to the project submission portal and Discord workspace.
Geoffrey: Let’s not wait until the last minute. IT should prepare automation for this. Geoffrey: Now that we’ve confirmed 300 participants, we must verify sponsor revenue covers this scale.
Cian: Exactly. More participants increase food, printing, and materials cost.
Max: Finance needs to validate whether our sponsor commitments are sufficient.
