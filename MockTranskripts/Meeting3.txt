Tim Tay: I received the email from Aryaman. Finance approved €400 for 300 bracelets.
Cian: Good. That clears the financial constraint.
Emer: I contacted two vendors yesterday. The best offer fits within the €400 budget.
Yoan: Delivery timeline?
Emer: 7 business days.
Tim Tay: That’s acceptable. Let’s place the order today to avoid risk.
Cian: Once the shipment arrives, we need someone to verify quantity and quality.
Yoan: I can handle verification.
Tim Tay: Good. The shipment must be checked immediately upon arrival and any defects reported the same day.
