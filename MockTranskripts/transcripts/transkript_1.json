  "Geoffrey: Cian, thanks for jumping on. We've got four big workstreams to lock down for Dublin — Admissions, Bracelets, Pizza, and Sponsors. Let's walk through each one, assign owners, and agree on the reporting chain. I want zero ambiguity on who does what and in what order.",
  "Cian: Agreed. Let's start with the one that's most time-sensitive.",
  "Geoffrey: This one gates everything else — we can't order bracelets or food until we know final headcount. Here's how I want it sequenced:",
  "Cian: Perfect. So the critical path is: Luke & Ishaan → Tim & Manon → Reuban, Rachel & Faith → Tim finalizes. Nothing downstream moves until 1.4 is done.",
  "Geoffrey: Exactly.",
  "Geoffrey: This is logistics-heavy but straightforward once we have the number.",
  "Cian: So the chain is: Design & UX delivers specs → Aryaman handles procurement → Tim handles receiving. Clear.",
  "Geoffrey: Everyone remembers the pizza. Let's make sure we get this right.",
  "Cian: So: Outreach collects dietary data → Aryaman and I pick the vendor → Tim places and manages the order. And Actions 3.1 and 3.2 can run in parallel — I can start scouting pizzerias while RSVPs are still coming in.",
  "Geoffrey: Exactly right. Parallel tracks where possible.",
  "Geoffrey: This one's the most critical in terms of revenue. We're short two sponsors and the clock is ticking.",
  "Cian: So: Billy builds the list → Design and Media prep the materials → Billy, Liam and Rachel do outreach → Billy and Aryaman close deals → Board is the safety net. And there's a hard 10-day checkpoint for escalation.",
  "Geoffrey: Correct. And I want Reuban kept in the loop on sponsor confirmations too — once we close a sponsor, Marketing needs to know immediately so they can plan co-branded content and social posts.",
  "Cian: Noted. I'll make sure that's in the reporting flow.",
  "Geoffrey: Let me lay it out simply:",
  "Cian: And all reporting flows back through either Tim for ops matters or me for Dublin-specific items, with you getting the executive summary on each milestone.",
  "Geoffrey: That's it. Let's get everyone moving. I'll send the kickoff message to department heads today. You brief the Dublin-side contacts.",
  "Cian: On it. Talk soon."
